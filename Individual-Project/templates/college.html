      <p class="secP"><mark>Pay attention to how you feel,</mark>  If something doesn’t feel right about a situation, it probably isn’t.  Even if your friends seem ok with what is going on, the situation may not be right for you.
      <br></br>
<mark>Plan ahead</mark>. Think about how you will respond in different situations.  Plan what you can say or what you can do.
       <br></br>
<mark>Talk to the person who is pressuring</mark>, let him or her know how it makes you feel and tell the person stop.
      <br></br>
</mark>Have friends with similar values and beliefs</mark>  It is easier to say “no” if someone else is also saying it.  Saying “no” together makes it easier for the both of you.</p>
